These are some of the blogs I have found to have some good content while I was creating this site.
As I find more I will continue to update the list with new ones I enjoy and maybe remove ones I stop enjoying.

These is in no particular order but I will add to the top to keep the most recent floating to the top

Is RSS even still a thing? I find it useful. It is a nice way to keep an eye on websites that I find get burried in social media and it is easier for me to keep groups of sites by theme so I can switch easily when my interests come in and out of focus. Plus being able to download batches means I can still have something to read when I am out of service or don't want to use data. 
I use [Feeder on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/) but you can also get it on [Google's Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nononsenseapps.feeder.play&hl=en_US&pli=1).
