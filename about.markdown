I have always been a nerd and enjoyed technology but as I get older I realize I would like it to take a bit more of a front seat in my life, be it through work or projects I make for fun. Life is all about learning and this is my blog where figure out where I might want to end up in the overwhelming world of information technology. 

This was born out of a need for a final project for [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), the first class in a series adapted from [OSSU's Computer Science Degree](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).

The name is an ode to a TED talk, [*Talk nerdy to me*](https://www.ted.com/talks/melissa_marshall_talk_nerdy_to_me), by Melissa Marshall from June 2012 that has clearly left an impression on me. 

Do you think I am missing something? Maybe there is an article you think I would be interested in or a snip of code that would help with a project I am working on, please reach out to me on any of my socials or email me!
