## Type nerdy to me
A blog where I discover more about technology and figure out where I might want to end up in the overwhelming world of information technology. 
Born out of a need for a final project for [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), the first class in a series adapted from [OSSU's Computer Science Degree](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). The name is an ode to a TED talk, [*Talk nerdy to me*](https://www.ted.com/talks/melissa_marshall_talk_nerdy_to_me), by Melissa Marshall from June 2012 that has clearly left an impression on me.
